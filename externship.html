                        <p>Welcome and congratulations on your successful application to the Externship/Clerkship affiliated with the Yale Podiatric Surgery Residency Program.</p>
                        <p>During the time you spend in our program, you will work closely with residents and staff physicians in a multidisciplinary setting, rotating at Yale-New Haven Hospital's two main campuses (York Street and St Raphael Campus) and the Veterans Administration Connecticut Healthcare System (VACT). Your experience will provide you with a wide range of practice situations including both clinical and surgical experiences. Regular academic meetings are held, both for your benefit, and the benefit of our residents and staff. We hope that your rotation is a rewarding educational experience with us. As part of the application process, you will be required to complete VA documents and return via email, before the start of your rotation. You will be contacted by Matt Seto, at the VACT Department of Podiatric Surgery, prior to your month with us. PLEASE complete the forms and return to Matt ASAP.</p>
                        <p>The Yale/VA Podiatric Externship Program’s mission is to offer late third and fourth year podiatric medical students a comprehensive academic, clinical, medical, and surgical experience utilizing a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
                        <p>Clerks generally spend 20 days at Yale New Haven Hospital campuses and 10 days at VACT campuses. They participate in and assist with surgical procedures, inpatient rounds/consults, outpatient clinics, and ED consultations. Clerks have the opportunity to research and provide a lecture/presentation during their clerkship.</p>
